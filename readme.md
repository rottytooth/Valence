# ᝎ

|---------------|:------------------------|

**ᝎ** (sometimes called Multi) is a programming language where every symbol is a homophone with multiple meanings. Context can sometimes determine the meaning of the symbol, but, the more complex the expression, the more possibilities are introduced.

In ᝎ:
* Any symbol can alternately be a variable name or an instruction
* All instructions have multiple meanings, as listed below
* Instructions can be combined in any order in a line of code
* Every possible reading of that line of code plays out, resulting in many parallel executions for a multi-line program. Some programs get stuck in infinite loops or can't be executed because of syntax errors. The others are treated equally.

## Instructions

Characters are borrowed from the *Buhid* alphabet, but there is no connection with languages that use that alphabet; they are selected as Unicode symbols resembling the drawn ᝎ symbols. They can also be represented by Roman characters as marked below. The keys corresponding to those letters are used to type the ᝎ characters on a Western keyboard.

symbol | typed as | pronunciation | meanings |
---|---|---|---
ᝈ |q | | binary, twoness, a doubling, conditional (two branches), second branch
ᝂ | w | | factors, dividing, stepwise, a movement toward entropy
ᝀ | e | | threeness, ternary conditional, a ternary value, else if 
ᝎ | r | | fourness, quarter, multiplying, coming to fruition, a float
ᝄ | e | | revealing, printing to the screen, or invoking immediate calculation
ᝐ | s | | fiveness, a decline, counting down, an integer, subtracting
ᝏ | d | | a const value, assignment, a string, else
ᝌ | f | | zero, end loop, end if, elimination
ᝃ | a | | 
ᝑ | s | | adding, exponential
ᝊ | d | | while loop, goto, a character, oneness, first branch 

## Example Programs

### Hello World

There is only one reading of this Hello World program, since the ᝄ has no alternate readings in this context:

    ᝄ"Hello, World!"

### FizzBuzz

Even a simple loop adds much ambiguity. Since Ints and Floats are formed using the ᝎ instructions, each ends up with several alternate values:

    ᝊᝌᝊᝐᝑᝎᝑᝐ
    ᝈᝊᝀᝂᝀᝄ"fizz"
    ᝈᝊᝀᝂᝐᝄ"buzz"
    ᝏᝄᝊ
    ᝌ

* ᝎ was inspired in part by the Oou conlang
