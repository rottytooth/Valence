# Valence

*Valence* is a programming language where each symbol is a homophone with multiple meanings. Context determines the meaning of the symbol; if multiple readings remain, each interpretation plays out in parallel.

In Valence:
* Any symbol can be read as a variable name, an octal digit, a command, a type, or an expression
* For commands and expressions, most symbols have multiple interpretations based on parameter count
* Every possible reading of a program plays out in parallel
* Brackets can disambiguate a phrase when needed

There is no single line of Valence that isn't valid; any combination of the signs has multiple meanings. However, some programs have mismatched brackets or (detectable) infinite loops; during execution, these are skipped.

## Project Status

Feel free to open issues or add failing tests for anything not already there. Here are the major things still in progress.

IN PROGRESS: 
* INPUT (currently non-functional)
* Support for TRADE OPERATION in the interpreter
* Full testing of Queue and casting
* Some display fixes

## Instructions

Each instruction is a single letter, borrowed from Ancient Greek numbering and measuring signs. While there is some association between some borrowed signs and usage, they all mean something significantly different in Valence.
