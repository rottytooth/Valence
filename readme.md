# 𐆉 (Valence)

**𐆉** (read as *Valence*) is a programming language where every symbol is a homophone with multiple meanings. Context can sometimes determine the meaning of the symbol, but, the more complex the expression, the more possibilities are introduced.

In 𐆉:
* Any symbol can alternately be a variable name or an instruction
* All instructions have multiple meanings, as listed below
* Instructions can be combined in any order in a line of code
* Every possible reading of that line of code plays out, resulting in many parallel executions of any program. Some programs get stuck in infinite loops or can't be executed because of syntax errors; if detectable, these programs are not built. The others are treated equally, and run in parallel.

## Instructions

Each instruction is a single letter, borrowed from Ancient Greek numbering and measuring signs. While there is some association between the borrowed sign and its usage (𐆋 for fourness, is the sign for a quarter), they all mean something significantly different in Valence.

symbol | typed as | meanings |
---|---|---|
𐅶 | q | binary, twoness, a doubling, conditional (two branches), second branch
𐆇 | w | factors, dividing, stepwise, a movement toward entropy
𐅾 | e | threeness, ternary conditional, a ternary value, else if 
𐆋 | r | fourness, quarter, multiplying, coming to fruition, a float
𐆉 | a | revealing, printing to the screen, or invoking immediate calculation
𐅻 | s | fiveness, a decline, counting down, an integer, subtracting
𐆌 | d | a const value, assignment, a string, else
𐆊 | f | zero, end loop, end if, elimination
𐆁 | z | while loop, goto, ???
𐆃 | x | adding, exponential
𐅘 | c | valence, unifying, a character, oneness, first branch 

## Example Programs

### Hello World

There is only one reading of this Hello World program, since the 𐆉 has no alternate readings in this context:

    𐆉Hello, World!

No quotes are needed, as any characters from outside the Valence lexicon are treated as a string. If quotes had been included, those quotes would have been interpreted as part of the string.

### FizzBuzz

Even a simple loop adds much ambiguity. Since Ints and Floats are formed using the 𐆋 instructions, each ends up with several alternate values:

    𐅘𐆊𐅘𐅻𐆃𐆋𐆃𐅻
    𐅶𐅘𐅾𐆇𐅾𐆉fizz
    𐅶𐅘𐅾𐆇𐅻𐆉buzz
    𐆌𐆉𐅘
    𐆊

* 𐅘 was inspired in part by the Oou conlang
